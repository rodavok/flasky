Flasky Fork
======
This repository is a fork of the flasky program from [Flask Web Development](http://www.flaskbook.com) by [Miguel Grinberg] (https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/) for educational purposes.

I will be using this fork to familiarize myself with how data is modeled and collected for an example production website.
